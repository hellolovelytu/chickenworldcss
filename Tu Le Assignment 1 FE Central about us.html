    <section>
        <h4>Sizes</h4>
        <p>You may heard about bantam and regular sizes chickens before. Bantam chickens are those weigh below 2lbs (under 1kg). They are cute and light. Regular size chickens have a wide range of weight depending on our breeds. We can get up to 10lbs (about 5kg). On average, a regualr chicken is about 5.7lbs (or 2.6kg).</p>

    <!-- This section is about temperaments. Using p tag for a summary about chicken temperaments, and an ordered list "ol" for listing some friendliest breeds. Each breed has li tag and is in a specific order-->
    <section>
        <h4>Temperaments</h4>
        <p>Choosing chickens are like choosing friends. You have to find a good fit for you and your flock. Chicken has a pecking order that can bring some dramas and heartbreak occasionally. Some are friendly and enjoying being handled. Some like being independent and shy. Some can be fearless. Most of them is curious (like a kid sometimes). Some of the friendliest breeds are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Silkie</li>
            <li>Speckle Sussex</li>
            <li>Buff Orpington</li>
            <li>Cochin</li>
            <li>Australorp</li>
        </ol>
