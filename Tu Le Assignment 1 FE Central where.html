    <h2>Where to buy</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Big stores</h3>
        <p>If you want to hand-pick your chick or hatching eggs, there are some chain stores you can visit. Boomgaar and Tractor Supply often have their "Chick days" from March until July.</p>

        <h3>Hatcheries</h3>
        <p>Some hatcheries are allowed people to come and pick up their chicks. Most of them will ship your chickens and hatching eggs through US Postal Services. Common hatcheries are Meyer, Cackle, McMurray, Stromberg and Valley. You can look up which hatcheries are near your location to reduce shipping and handling fee. They can ship year round.</p>

        <h3>Local farms and ranches</h3>
